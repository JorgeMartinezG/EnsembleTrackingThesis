abstract = {Most approaches for estimating optical flow assume that, within a finite image region, only a single motion is present. Thissingle motion assumptionis violated in common situations involving transparency, depth discontinuities, independently moving objects, shadows, and specular reflections. To robustly estimate optical flow, the single motion assumption must be relaxed. This paper presents a framework based onrobust estimationthat addresses violations of the brightness constancy and spatial smoothness assumptions caused by multiple motions. We show how therobust estimation frameworkcan be applied to standard formulations of the optical flow problem thus reducing their sensitivity to violations of their underlying assumptions. The approach has been applied to three standard techniques for recovering optical flow: area-based regression, correlation, and regularization with motion discontinuities. This paper focuses on the recovery of multiple parametric motion models within a region, as well as the recovery of piecewise-smooth flow fields, and provides examples with natural and synthetic image sequences.},

@article{Canny1986,
abstract = {This paper describes a computational approach to edge detection. The success of the approach depends on the definition of a comprehensive set of goals for the computation of edge points. These goals must be precise enough to delimit the desired behavior of the detector while making minimal assumptions about the form of the solution. We define detection and localization criteria for a class of edges, and present mathematical forms for these criteria as functionals on the operator impulse response. A third criterion is then added to ensure that the detector has only one response to a single edge. We use the criteria in numerical optimization to derive detectors for several common image features, including step edges. On specializing the analysis to step edges, we find that there is a natural uncertainty principle between detection and localization performance, which are the two main goals. With this principle we derive a single operator shape which is optimal at any scale. The optimal detector has a simple approximate implementation in which edges are marked at maxima in gradient magnitude of a Gaussian-smoothed image. We extend this simple detector using operators of several widths to cope with different signal-to-noise ratios in the image. We present a general method, called feature synthesis, for the fine-to-coarse integration of information from operators at different scales. Finally we show that step edge detector performance improves considerably as the operator point spread function is extended along the edge.},

abstract = { A new approach toward target representation and localization, the central component in visual tracking of nonrigid objects, is proposed. The feature histogram-based target representations are regularized by spatial masking with an isotropic kernel. The masking induces spatially-smooth similarity functions suitable for gradient-based optimization, hence, the target localization problem can be formulated using the basin of attraction of the local maxima. We employ a metric derived from the Bhattacharyya coefficient as similarity measure, and use the mean shift procedure to perform the optimization. In the presented tracking examples, the new method successfully coped with camera motion, partial occlusions, clutter, and target scale variations. Integration with motion filters and data association techniques is also discussed. We describe only a few of the potential applications: exploitation of background information, Kalman tracking using motion models, and face tracking.},

We use two kinds of decision rules: one for which the decision regions are convex polyhedra (a piecewise linear decision rule), and one for which the decision regions are rectangular parallelpipeds (a min-max decision rule). In each experiment the data set was divided into two parts, a training set and a test set. Test set identification accuracy is 89 percent for the photomicrographs, 82 percent for the aerial photographic imagery, and 83 percent for the satellite imagery. These results indicate that the easily computable textural features probably have a general applicability for a wide variety of image-classification applications.},

A second constraint is needed. A method for finding the optical flow pattern is presented which assumes that the apparent velocity of the brightness pattern varies smoothly almost everywhere in the image. An iterative implementation is shown which successfully computes the optical flow for a number of synthetic image sequences. The algorithm is robust in that it can handle image sequences that are quantized rather coarsely in space and time. It is also insensitive to quantization of brightness levels and additive noise. Examples are included where the assumption of smoothness is violated at singular points or along lines in the image.},

abstract = {RGB, a nonuniform color space, is almost universally accepted by
the image processing community as the means for representing color. On
the other hand, perceptually uniform spaces, such as L*a*b*, as well as
approximately-uniform color spaces, such as HSV, exist, in which
measured color differences are proportional to the human perception of
such differences. This paper compares RGB with L*a*b* and HSV in terms
of their effectiveness in color texture analysis. There has been a
limited but increasing amount of work on the color aspects of textured
images. The results have shown that incorporating color into a texture
analysis and recognition scheme can be very important and beneficial.
The presented methodology uses a family of Gabor filters specially tuned
to measure specific orientations and sizes within each color texture.
Effectiveness is measured by the classification performance of each
color space, as well as by classifier-independent measures. Experimental
results are obtained with a variety of color texture Images.
Perceptually uniform spaces are shown to outperform RGB in many cases

The general problem of multiframe point correspondence is NP-hard for three or more frames. A polynomial time algorithm for a restriction of this problem is presented and is used as the basis of the proposed greedy algorithm for the general problem. The greedy nature of the proposed algorithm allows it to be used in real-time systems for tracking and surveillance, etc. In addition, the proposed algorithm deals with the problems of occlusion, missed detections, and false positives by using a single noniterative greedy optimization scheme and, hence, reduces the complexity of the overall algorithm as compared to most existing approaches where multiple heuristics are used for the same purpose. While most greedy algorithms for point tracking do not allow for entry and exit of the points from the scene, this is not a limitation for the proposed algorithm. Experiments with real and synthetic data over a wide range of scenarios and system parameters are presented to validate the claims about the performance of the proposed algorithm.},
