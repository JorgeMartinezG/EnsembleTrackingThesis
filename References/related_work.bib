abstract = {Under the three-year Video Surveillance and Monitoring (VSAM) project (1997-1999), the Robotics Institute at Carnegie Mellon University (CMU) and the Sarnoff Corporation developed a system for autonomous Video Surveillance and Monitoring. The technical approach uses multiple, cooperative video sensors to provide continuous coverage of people and vehicles in a cluttered environment. This final report presents an overview of the system, and of the technical accomplishments that have been achieved.},

abstract = {Camera based systems are routinely used for monitoring highway traffic, supplementing inductive loops and microwave sensors employed for counting purposes. These techniques achieve very good counting accuracy and are capable of discriminating trucks and cars. However, pedestrians and cyclists are mostly counted manually. In this paper, we describe a new camera based automatic system that utilizes Kalman filtering in tracking and Learning Vector Quantization for classifying the observations to pedestrians and cyclists. Both the requirements for such systems and the algorithms used are described. The tests performed show that the system achieves around 80-90\% accuracy in counting and classification. © 2003 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

@article{Lipton1998a,
abstract = {This paper describes an end-to-end method for extracting moving targets from a real-time video stream, classifying them into predefined categories according to image-based properties, and then robustly tracking them. Moving targets are detected using the pixel wise difference between consecutive image frames. A classification metric is applied these targets with a temporal consistency constraint to classify them into three categories: human, vehicle or background clutter. Once classified targets are tracked by a combination of temporal differencing and template matching. The resulting system robustly identifies targets of interest, rejects background clutter and continually tracks over large distances and periods of time despite occlusions, appearance changes and cessation of target motion},

@article{McIvor2000,
abstract = {We present 3 methods for the subtraction of non-cosmic and unresolved cosmic backgrounds observed by the Low-Energy Concentrator Spectrometer (LECS) on-board BeppoSAX. Removal of these backgrounds allows a more accurate modeling of the spectral data from point and small-scale extended sources. At high (>25 degree) galactic latitudes, subtraction using a standard background spectrum works well. At low galactic latitudes, or in complex regions of the X-ray sky, two alternative methods are presented. The first uses counts obtained from two semi-annuli near the outside of the LECS field of view to estimate the background at the source location. The second method uses ROSAT Position Sensitive Proportional Counter (PSPC) all-sky survey data to estimate the LECS background spectrum for a given pointing position. A comparison of the results from these methods provides an estimate of the systematic uncertainties. For high galactic latitude fields, all 3 methods give 3 sigma confidence uncertainties of <0.9 10 -3 count/s (0.1-10 keV), or <1.5 10 -3 count/s (0.1-2 keV). These correspond to 0.1-2.0 keV fluxes of 0.7-1.8 and 0.5-1.1 10 -13 erg/cm2/s for a power-law spectrum with a photon index of 2 and photoelectric absorption of 3 10 20 and 3 10 21 atom/cm2, respectively. At low galactic latitudes, or in complex regions of the X-ray sky, the uncertainties are a factor \~{}2.5 higher.},

@article{Wang2003,
abstract = {Visual analysis of human motion is currently one of the most active research topics in computer vision. This strong interest is driven by a wide spectrum of promising applications in many areas such as virtual reality, smart surveillance, perceptual interface, etc. Human motion analysis concerns the detection, tracking and recognition of people, and more generally, the understanding of human behaviors, from image sequences involving humans. This paper provides a comprehensive survey of research on computer-vision-based human motion analysis. The emphasis is on three major issues involved in a general human motion analysis system, namely human detection, tracking and activity understanding. Various methods for each issue are discussed in order to examine the state of the art. Finally, some research challenges and future directions are discussed. © 2002 Pattern Recognition Society.
