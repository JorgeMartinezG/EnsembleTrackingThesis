In this thesis, we demonstrated that an online ensemble of trackers can result
in improved performance with respect to each individual tracker. Our framework
considers the spatial coherence and appearance of the predicted target locations
to ensemble a final estimate of the target state. We leverage high confidence
estimation to reinitialize trackers that fail and steer them towards the true
region. Our experiments show that our simple but effective technique can achieve
state-of-the-art tracking performance in benchmarking sequences.
