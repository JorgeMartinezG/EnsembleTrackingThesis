The object tracking literature offers a large variety of tracking
methods, which exhibit complementary properties in terms of
their performance, best usage scenarios and failure modes.
In this paper, we introduce a new tracking algorithm based on
an online ensemble of tracking algorithms. Our method runs
multiple online trackers in parallel and fuses their outputs in an online
fashion. The resulting tracker can leverage the strenghts
and overcome failures of each individual tracker, producing more robust
target tracking. We perform experiments on current object tracking
benchmark and show how our ensemble consistently outperforms all
trackers in the ensemble, and achieves state-of-the-art object tracking
performance.
